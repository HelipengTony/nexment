# Sad-Dev Dairy

Although I feel very sad, but I have to admit that I've switched to TDSX which is a quick tool for Typescript library dev environment setup, by doing that I can fix the problem with Invalid React Hook which appears to be unfixable at this time by myself. Shame on me, I will figure out the real cause as soon as possible.
Let's just focus on development for now.
